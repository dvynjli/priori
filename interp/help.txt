Q. Do we need variable in env for all SSA variables?
A. Yes. Otherwise we need to do computation on source program, which require making a c++ parser.

Q. Load and AtomicLoad (and store) can be handled same way?
A. From Apron point of view - yes, 
    from Z3 - yes
    from static analyzer - no (race detection)

Q. How to handle interferences of a thread with itself if more than one instance of a thread is executing?
A. ???

Q. What to do for loops?
A. 

Q. What to do for function arguments?
A.


Instructions that need Apron interface-
    BinOp   +, -, *, /, %, &&, ||, rmw, 
            &, | (can be added later)
    UnaryOp !, load, store
            -, ~ (can be added later)
    CmpXchg
    Function calls (can be added later)
Instructions that need Z3 interface-
    thread create, thread join, fences, lock,

TODO:
    init local vars with TOP, not zero
    check how to merge environments from two different iteration (due to different interferences)
    get load store pairs only ones (from initThreadDetails) - 
        need to stop analysis if load reads from a store that is unreachable so far (should not be in domain map)


Race detection on non-atomics - if a non aomic load can read from more than one writes



Possible Optimizations:
    don't support thread creation from functions other than main()
        reduced one pass over program
    Reduce number of maps (if maps are taking too much time):
        run a pass to give instr id to each intruction and store the environment of the intructions in this order or make a wrapper around Instructions


    parallelization
        checking feasiblity of interfernces with analysis of other thread
        analysis of all threads for 1 iteration
