Q. Do we need variable in anv for all SSA variables?
A. Yes. Otherwise we need to do computation on source program, which require making a c++ parser.

Q. Load and AtomicLoad (and store) can be handled same way?
A. From Apron point of view - yes, 
    from Z3 - yes
    from static analyzer - no (race detection)

Q. How to handle interferences of a thread with itself if more than one instance of a thread is executing?
A. ???


Instructions that need Apron interface-
    BinOp   +, -, *, /, %, &&, ||, rmw, 
            &, | (can be added later)
    UnaryOp !, -, load, store
            ~ (can be added later)
    CmpXchg
    Function calls (can be added later)
Instructions that need Z3 interface-
    thread create, thread join, fences, lock,



Race detection on non-atomics - if a non aomic load can read from more than one writes
