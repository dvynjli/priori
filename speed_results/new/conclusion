Parallelization in Feasible Interfs:
	Any paallelization done for interf is causing slow-down in even in szymanski
	even if the size to actually do parallization is > 10,000,000 i.e. 
	no benchmarks are actually running in paralle. Overhead is too much

Parallilization in analysis
	Works for #feasible interfs > 200
	Very small benchmarks have overhead
	Try for other smaller values
	Try dividing in chuncks of 200 for bigger (szymanki) benchmarks
