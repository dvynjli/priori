Benchmark tpoll:
	has two phi nodes in single basic block working on two different variables coming from the same branch,
	since current implementation takes valiue from the basic block maked in phi, the second phi node overwites the values of first variables. How to fix it?
	also has xor operation: not implemented
	with <=30 opt-bisect-limit, has br i1 true
	with no opt-bisect-limit, has phi i32* nodes

szymanski.cc: 
	no need to load twice during the exit protocol
	acc to algo (wiki), the exit checking is only for proceeses numbered later, but the Tracer's testcase is doing this for all
	sv-comp has done the same thing
tbar_unfenenced:
	Doesn't have bug in 2 unrolling
lamport_assume_fenced
	the three comments fencess are not required
	VBMC K=4, L=6 is not giving error without those
	checked with tracer
